// The one question the bot AI asks the remote commander (issue #884): is this
// bot in a group some commander has bound? The "master left the party, so
// leave" rule (ai/playerbot/strategy/actions/LeaveGroupAction.h) skips such a
// bot, because the bound group's instance bind would be lost with it. The
// answer is read from the binding table in commands/BotCommands.cpp (world
// thread only); the AI includes this header instead of the command layer.
